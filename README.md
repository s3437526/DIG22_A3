# DIG22_A3
DIG 22 Website

Things to note about this version:
- Expanding the window manually with the menu active (when transitioning from smaller screen to larger) does not show heading menu once it triggers the next largest viewport size. It requires page refresh to reload the menu. 

- Selecting each respective sized device works as expected.

- Animation does not work with menu sliding in and out of view after toggling hamburger. It just appears in and disappears out.

Fix desktop layout
 - Hero not fitting in full height
